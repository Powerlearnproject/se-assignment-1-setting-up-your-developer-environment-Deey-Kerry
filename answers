Hardware Requirements:
•	Challenge: Windows 11 has stricter hardware requirements, including TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, which may not be present in older computers.
•	Solution: Before attempting installation, check your PC's compatibility using Microsoft's PC Health Check tool. If your hardware doesn't meet the requirements, consider upgrading components like the motherboard or TPM module, or sticking with Windows 10.
Installation Errors:
•	Challenge: Errors during installation such as freezing or unexpected restarts can occur.
•	Solution: Ensure your installation media (USB or DVD) is not corrupted. Check for updated drivers and firmware for your hardware before installation. If errors persist, try installing Windows 11 using a different installation media or method (e.g., USB instead of DVD).
Activation Problems:
•	Challenge: Activation issues may arise due to product key errors or licensing discrepancies.
•	Solution: Double-check that you're using a valid product key for Windows 11. If you upgraded from Windows 10, ensure your Windows 10 was activated before the upgrade. Use the Activation Troubleshooter in Windows settings or contact Microsoft support for assistance.
Application Compatibility:
•	Challenge: Some applications may not work correctly on Windows 11 due to compatibility issues.
•	Solution: Check with the software vendors for updates or patches that support Windows 11. Consider using compatibility modes or virtualization tools for older software. Alternatively, explore alternative applications that are compatible with Windows 11.


Data Loss:
•	Challenge: Incorrect installation procedures or upgrading without proper backups can lead to data loss.
•	Solution: Before upgrading, perform a full backup of your important files and settings. Use Windows' built-in backup tools or third-party software to create a system image. Verify your backups before proceeding with the installation to ensure you can restore your data if something goes wrong.
